Hello! I'm Jared, currently a Software Engineer at Amazon in Seattle. I got my M.S. in CS at the University of Southern California, and before that my B.S. in Physics and CS at Tufts University.

I'm looking to join a research lab as a PhD student in 2024!

My research interests lie in data management, applied ML, and urban informatics. Specifically:
  * üìù Tools for **managing raw data**
      * How can we bridge the gap between collecting data and using it?
  * üí° Using ML to **extract insight**
      * How can ML/computation help us extract more value out of our data?
      * How can ML lead us to results that would have taken longer to reach without ML?
  * üöû Building **better cities**
      * City design impacts our lives in fundamental ways we may not realize: accessibility, sustainability, equity, etc.
      * How can we use ML/computational methods to extract insight about our cities and how humans live?
      * How can this insight guide us in designing better cities?

Check out my [Research](/research/) and [CV](/cv_file/hwang_CV.pdf) to see how my interests got to where they are now.
